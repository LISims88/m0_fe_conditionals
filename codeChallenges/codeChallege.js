//Write a JavaScript program that defines a variable that stores a Number. 
//The program should print out the String "even" if the Number is even, and the String "odd" if the Number is odd. 
//Hint: You may need to do some extra research on the remainder operator (%) to solve this challenge.

var Number = 7
if (Number % 2 == 0) {
  console.log("even")
  } else {
  console.log("odd")
  }
